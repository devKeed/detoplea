      title: "Why Ecommerce Brands Need to Start Outsourcing Email Marketing",
      introduction:
        "It’s no secret that email marketing is still one of the most effective tools in the digital marketing playbook. It’s reliable, cost-effective, and consistently drives return on investment when it’s done right. But for many ecommerce businesses, that’s the catch which makes outsourcing email marketing the best decision. Many email campaigns are rushed, poorly designed, and lack strategy leading to low open rates, weak conversions, and newsletters that feel more like guesswork than revenue drivers. Sound familiar? If your email marketing feels more like a chore than a growth engine, it might be time to think differently specifically, about outsourcing it. In this post, we’ll break down what’s going wrong, why it’s holding your business back, and how outsourcing your email marketing can turn it into one of your most powerful sales channels.",
